Meet A, the often overwhelmed multitasker! By day, she's a coding wizard, rocking the world as a full stack developer. But when the office hours are over, she transforms into Emo Mom, managing the chaos with a smile and a side of humor.

But wait, there's more! Ariel isn't just about coding and parenting; she's also a bookworm and word maestro. Give her a good book, and she'll disappear into a different universe. And when she's not devouring novels, she's probably busy cooking up her own stories - because why not add 'author' to the list of her many failures?
